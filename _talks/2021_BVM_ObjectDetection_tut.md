The remarkable rise of deep learning has led to an overwhelming amount of new papers
coming up by the week. This tutorial intends to filter out the research most relevant for
the medical image computing (MIC) community and present it in a structured and
understandable form. It will cover recent developments related to common tasks in the
community (e.g. segmentation, detection), but will also discuss methods that are currently
gaining traction. Basic knowledge of neural networks and deep
learning is recommended.
